<h1>Why AI Can Be Harmful to Teenagers</h1>
<p> Artificial intelligence is becoming a big part of teenagers lives. Many young people use AI for studying, entertainment, and communication. However, AI can also be harmful to teenagers in several ways.

First, AI can reduce critical thinking. When teenagers rely too much on AI to do homework or make decisions, they may stop thinking independently. This can affect their creativity and problem-solving skills.

Second, AI can influence mental health. Social media algorithms and AI chatbots may create unrealistic standards and addictive behaviors. Teenagers can feel pressure to be perfect, which may lead to anxiety or low self-esteem.

Finally, AI can limit real human communication. Spending too much time with AI systems can reduce face-to-face interactions, which are very important for emotional development during adolescence.

In conclusion, AI is a powerful tool, but teenagers need guidance and balance to use it safely and responsibly.</p>
